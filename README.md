# ImageEncryptor
 1.This application is to encrypt and decrypt images using java.
 2.Where user should give a specific key as an input and select any image file.
   [ As we know Images are binary data - this is easily represented as byte arrays.The image in the sample is stored in the database as a BLOB-
   not a string or location that is, it is binary data, thus the encrypt function changes the bytes with key and vice versa.]
 3.Same key should apply for decrypting your image 
 4.Used java swing to create gui.
